In this tutorial, I dive into the world of **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment using Azure's powerful services**. Here's a breakdown of what's covered:

ðŸ”§ **CICD with Azure Pipeline and Azure Web App** ðŸ”§

âœ… Create an Azure Free Trial or Azure Pay-As-You-Go subscription on Azure DevOps.
âœ… Establish a service connection between Azure DevOps and the Azure Portal.
âœ… Set up an Azure Web App on the Azure Portal.
âœ… Create an Azure Pipeline linked to GitHub for deploying a web calculator app on Azure Web App.
âœ… Configuration of CICD on Azure Pipeline with a Pipeline trigger to automate the build and deployment on every GitHub repository commit.
âœ… Verify the CICD pipeline by initiating a test commit on the GitHub repository.
